![game_screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40887002/127489118-7ae75f76-7cb4-48f6-bc82-c1517a2a4243.jpeg)

Hit The Target is a hypercasual game for Unity mobile platform with Huawei Mobile Services Plugin GameService integration.

It is a simple rock throw game to pop the balloons in a very limited number of shoots.

Purpose: Pop as many balloons as you can.

**GameService Features:**

GameService has three main features: Achievements, Leaderboards and SaveGame.

This game contains all three. After the users complete a game, depending on their score, they will unlock three achievements in total; each of which being a bit tougher than the other.

Game features a leaderboard that can be accessed through the pause menu. When you lose the game or simply pause it, you can access leaderboards and see how the other players performed versus you and others.

This reference game has also SaveGame feature implemented. Users can save the game's current status to the cloud and load a saved game from the save game menu, that can be accessed from the pause menu. The game will automatically not allow saving games that are already over, i.e. with rock count being 0.

GameService requires AccountKit to work. However, thanks to plugin, you do not need to worry about using it with code. Just tick the button in the GameService page and it will handle the initializations in the background.
